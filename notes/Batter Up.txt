Notes:
Is a "color-ed" port of the first Famista game
on Game Boy (known in US as Extra Bases!).

I was found on the start of ROM, the followed
copyright: 1986 1991 NAMCO LTD. ALL RIGHTS 
RESERVED (C)1991 TAKASHI FUKAWA. This guy is
the composer or the creator of game?

The Heiseiban Edition of Gear Stadium is just a
updated version with the original Nippon
Professional Baseball teams (plus with Namco
Stars and a custom team that includes some
american characters), instead of clones
but nothing special. Gear Stadium Heiseiban is
the last Namco game on Game Gear.

I can tell the musics that play on other games:

Title Screen: Famista '89 (FC) - Famista 2 (GB);
Team Select: Family Stadium '88 (FC) - Famista 4
(GB, Namco Collection Vol. 2)
Play Ball: Family Stadium (FC) - Famista 4
Play Ball (voice): World Stadium (AC)
Main Theme: Famista '89 - Famista 4
Chance Theme: Famista '89 - Famista 4
Change: Family Stadium - Famista 4
Game Set: Family Stadium - Famista 4
Sports News: Unknown, sorry...
Sound Test 3 & 5: Again, unknown...
Sound Test 10: Family Stadim '88, Edit Mode.

Famista 4 is identically to Famista 3 (GB), only
NPB teams rosters was updated (I think), and
runs with some colors in Super Game Boy mode.

I was found a strange thing with my hacking
methods (why?): I was found the people in stadium
displaying some V's (something in kanji in Gear 
Stadium) and plays the Track 12. I think that is
ending scene (but is very kinda crappy and 
understandable...). And in the Omake Screenshot
(the one with girl cheerleader tired) plays the 
Track 10. Both screens you cannot do anything
(only Reset).

Read the topic in SMS Power about the VGM Pack to
see one screenshot.
