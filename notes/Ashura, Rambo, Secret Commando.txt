Notes:
"Main Title" came from "Rambo: First Blood Part II - Original Film Soundtrack,
New Expanded Edition". It is an arrangement of the original film soundtrack by
Jerry Goldsmith.

While "Title Screen" does not appear in Rambo, and "Main Title" does not appear
in Ashura or Secret Commando, all files are tagged with all three games' names.
This allows them to be better handled together by music management software.
