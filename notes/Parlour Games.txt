Notes:
1) I did my best with song names... change them to your liking!

2) Bingo's "You Win" and "You Lost" can be considered SEs because
        they play ON TOP OF other music, but since it is a "tune"
        they have been included as songs... 

3) The specific names of the "Unused" songs are an educated guess as to
        what they were supposed to be.  Both songs were found between
        other "Darts" songs. (Using "memory trigger hack" at (CE02).
        a) Unused-Darts-301 or 501 *because 301 and 501 have the same
                song in the game. Mistake/Last minute change...?
        b) Unused-Darts-Winner Player *because it plays the same song
                whether you win or lose.  Mistake...?  I chose winner
                because the song in the game sounds like you lost!
                (...though the "unused" song doesn't exactly sound like
                you have just won either...)
        c) of course there is the chance that they actually ARE played
                somewhere, and that I just didn't make it there...
                but due to their location (as stated before) I assume
                that (a) and (b) are probably true (and unreachable
                in the game).

4) Using the "memory trigger hacking" at (CE02)...
        $9C and $9D play the same song... Are they the same?  I can't
                remember which one I used...
        
5) In the track tags I could add "katakana" versions of the song names I
        created, but is that really necessary (because I created them...)?

6) I still don't know the original author of the music (wish I knew...
        this is some pretty cool music!).  The game has no built-in
        credits, and the manual (which I do have, but cannot get to)
        may or may not have it.  So if someone could kindly check the
        manual for me...please...        

7) School Sucks... can't do any fun stuff...!
