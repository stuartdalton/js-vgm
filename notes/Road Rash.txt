Notes:
The Master System and Game Gear versions of the game have identical music.

Both versions detect if the machine is PAL or NTSC and the music speed is
adjusted to be the same on both.

The game credits "Krisalis" software house for the music. That means the audio
driver was written by Shaun Hollingworth and music was converted by Matt
Furniss, from the original game music by Rob Hubbard.
