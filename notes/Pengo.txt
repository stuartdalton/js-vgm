Notes:
"Intermission & Ending Theme" is based on
Ludwig van Beethoven's "Ode To Joy".
The in-game music will speed up after a while
like an "hurry up" feature. It will stay fast
until you clear the level or you loose a life.
Some tracks are not using all PSG channels:
level presentation doesn't use channel 2, and
the three diamond bonus doesn't use noise
channel.
