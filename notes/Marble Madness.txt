Notes:
Tracks ripped by fx^ from the sound test and updated
tags by Yawackhary which was compared to the arcade
original (and also uses the arcade names for the tracks).
Tune 09 is not in the arcade version and is currently
unknown which is done by Matt Furniss himself. All
other tracks are arrangements of the original arcade
songs, written by Brad Fuller and Hal Canon.
