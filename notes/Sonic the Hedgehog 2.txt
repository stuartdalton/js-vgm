Notes:
Grass-eatin'me logged the Game Gear version.

For the redump, the Master System version was
used where both versions have equal tracks.
Also the rerips are sample-accurate, because
I was unable to find an offset without rounding
errors.
But I optimized them with vgm_smp1 -delay:30 to
make them a least a little smaller.
